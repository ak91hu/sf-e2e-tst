# SF-OPP-002 — Required field: Opportunity Name

[All test designs](https://github.com/ak91hu/sf-e2e-tst/wiki) · [Executable source](https://github.com/ak91hu/sf-e2e-tst/blob/main/tests/opportunity.e2e.ts) · [Allure report](https://sf-e2e-tst-allure-ak91hu.netlify.app)

**Role:** E2E Sales Manager

**Preconditions:** JWT Web scope and role permissions configured; Salesforce Lightning, en_US UI, Europe/Budapest user timezone; one worker and isolated owned data. Standard Quote enabled; object UI permissions follow the assigned role.

**Test data:** Unique E2E-TA- name (timestamp + UUID); every Account and business record belongs to this case’s fixture. Empty/--None--: Opportunity Name; other required fields valid.

The following steps define expected behavior. Execution status is recorded in Allure and [verification evidence](https://github.com/ak91hu/sf-e2e-tst/blob/main/docs/VERIFICATION.md); this page does not claim an execution result. Generated dates, names and IDs are substituted at runtime.

| Action | Data | Expected output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Restore the saved Lightning session for the assigned role. | Saved role session: E2E Sales Manager; configured JWT client and private key (values withheld). | JWT setup has verified the active user through UI; the user is not an administrator. |
| 2. Open New Account and enter a unique Account Name. | Account Name = generated E2E-TA- name (timestamp + UUID); owned Account ID after Save. | Save and editable Account Name are visible; the entered value reads back correctly. |
| 3. Save the Account and open its record page. | Account Name = generated E2E-TA- name (timestamp + UUID); owned Account ID after Save. | The form closes; the URL contains the Account ID; the exact Account name appears as a heading. |
| 4. Prepare the Opportunity form, leaving only the tested required field empty or --None--. | Unique E2E-TA- name (timestamp + UUID); every Account and business record belongs to this case’s fixture. Empty/--None--: Opportunity Name; other required fields valid. | Owned Account prefilled; other fields completed; no Opportunity ID before Save. |
| 5. Press Save. | Unique E2E-TA- name (timestamp + UUID); every Account and business record belongs to this case’s fixture. Empty/--None--: Opportunity Name; other required fields valid. | Opportunity Name has aria-invalid = true; creation dialog remains open. |
| 6. Cancel and search for the exact owned Opportunity name. | Unique E2E-TA- name (timestamp + UUID); every Account and business record belongs to this case’s fixture. Empty/--None--: Opportunity Name; other required fields valid. | The dialog closes; no matching record exists. |
| 7. Fixture teardown deletes only this case’s journaled records through UI in dependency order; discard unfinished forms. | This case’s exact owned record IDs, names and Description markers in .e2e-data; order: Quote, Contract, Opportunity, Case, Price Book, Product, Account. | The UI leaves each deleted record URL; exact-name search finds no record. Journal deleted becomes true only after proven deletion or absence. Failed cleanup retains the journal for targeted UI recovery. |
