# SF-OPP-014 — Persist a past Close Date on an open Opportunity

[All test designs](https://github.com/ak91hu/sf-e2e-tst/wiki) · [Executable source](https://github.com/ak91hu/sf-e2e-tst/blob/main/tests/opportunity.e2e.ts) · [Allure report](https://sf-e2e-tst-allure-ak91hu.netlify.app)

**Role:** E2E Sales Manager

**Preconditions:** JWT Web scope and role permissions configured; Salesforce Lightning, en_US UI, Europe/Budapest user timezone; one worker and isolated owned data. Standard Quote enabled; object UI permissions follow the assigned role.

**Test data:** Unique E2E-TA- name (timestamp + UUID); every Account and business record belongs to this case’s fixture. Close Date = UTC today -7 days; Prospecting; Amount = 12345.67 USD.

The following steps define expected behavior. Execution status is recorded in Allure and [verification evidence](https://github.com/ak91hu/sf-e2e-tst/blob/main/docs/VERIFICATION.md); this page does not claim an execution result. Generated dates, names and IDs are substituted at runtime.

| Action | Data | Expected output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Restore the saved Lightning session for the assigned role. | Saved role session: E2E Sales Manager; configured JWT client and private key (values withheld). | JWT setup has verified the active user through UI; the user is not an administrator. |
| 2. Open New Account and enter a unique Account Name. | Account Name = generated E2E-TA- name (timestamp + UUID); owned Account ID after Save. | Save and editable Account Name are visible; the entered value reads back correctly. |
| 3. Save the Account and open its record page. | Account Name = generated E2E-TA- name (timestamp + UUID); owned Account ID after Save. | The form closes; the URL contains the Account ID; the exact Account name appears as a heading. |
| 4. Create an Opportunity under the owned Account with Close Date seven days in the past; Save. | Generated Opportunity name; owned Account ID; UTC date -7 days; Prospecting; 12345.67 USD; default description. | The dialog closes; the owned Opportunity ID is known. |
| 5. Open fresh Details and verify the complete Opportunity. | Owned Opportunity ID; date -7 days; original Amount 12345.67 USD and Prospecting. | The exact past date persists; all fields, Account link and Sales Owner/Created By are correct. |
| 6. Fixture teardown deletes only this case’s journaled records through UI in dependency order; discard unfinished forms. | This case’s exact owned record IDs, names and Description markers in .e2e-data; order: Quote, Contract, Opportunity, Case, Price Book, Product, Account. | The UI leaves each deleted record URL; exact-name search finds no record. Journal deleted becomes true only after proven deletion or absence. Failed cleanup retains the journal for targeted UI recovery. |
